package pptx


Package pptx creates and adds slides to powerpoint presentations.

The package can be used to create simple powerpoint pptx files or to append
slides to an existing presentation.

The file format is a compressed zip archive with xml files and images. The
package unpacks the archive in memory, adds files and manipulates existing
xml files to add new slides. It uses github.com/beevik/etree for xml
operations.

The aim of the package is not to support all of powerpoint's possibilities
but to understand just enough to be able to add new slides to an existing
presentation.

Supported are:

Textboxes

    - Position
    - Font, Fontsize
    - Multiline text
    - mark as title

Item lists

Images
